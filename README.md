##The Problem

Climate Change is real and farmers are one of the first
ones to be affected by it. To adapt to climate change
they need help and assistance mainly from the public
sector through various government programs, grants, and
training. The problem is there are many such programs
and grants available but the data is highly unstructured
on the internet and each program requires a complex
application process and there are multiple points of
contact that the farmer has to reach out to for
assistance. Not every farmer is tech-savvy enough to
navigate all of this and there is a need to simplify this process.
